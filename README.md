# Credit Risk Classification
Machine learning classifiers inspired by Kaggle users and applied on German credit data.

### Project Overview
I used machine learning classification algorithms to predict credit risk using the German credit dataset. I applied preprocessing and feature extraction techniques using Pandas to create data visualizations and better understand the dataset. I split the original dataset into training and testing data, and I used K-fold cross validation on various models to determine those with the highest mean accuracy.

I trained seven models: Logistical Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, and Multi Layer Perceptron. I improved and evaluated the performance of the top two models, which were the Gaussian Naive Bayes and MLP classifiers, on the testing data using methods such as accuracy and confusion matrix. I achieved an accuracy of 79% on the training set and 77% on the testing set, and I analyze possible reasons for the 75-80% accuracy score.


### Code and Analysis
My Python code and analysis are in the Jupyter Notebook file that you may need to download for viewing. In the future, separate Python and Markdown files may be made available to make my work more accessible.
